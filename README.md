# Hybrid Stacking Model for VANET Attack Detection

## Overview
Developed a machine learning-based intrusion detection system to detect DDoS, Sybil, and Blackhole attacks in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs).

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Stacking ensemble model (Naive bayes Classifier, SVC, KNN)
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Results
Achieved 99.9% accuracy with reduced false positives compared to individual models.

## My Contribution
- Implemented preprocessing and feature engineering
- Built stacking ensemble model
- Performed model evaluation and analysis
